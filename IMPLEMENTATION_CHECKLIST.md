## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **PoW too slow on Pi** → Implement adaptive difficulty, test early
- **Storage limits on low-end devices** → Implement partial hosting, sharding
- **NAT traversal failures** → Implement relay nodes, TURN-like fallback
- **Gossip bandwidth too high** → Optimize message size, implement compression

### Security Risks
- **Key theft** → Hardware-backed keys, encrypted storage, rotation
- **Sybil attack** → PoW/PoStake gating, reputation, social vouching
- **DDoS** → Rate limiting, redundancy, no single point of failure
- **Content poisoning** → Hash verification, multi-source checking

### Community Risks
- **Low adoption** → Focus on fun use case (games), marketing
- **Spam/abuse** → Capability tokens, moderation tools
- **Negative feedback** → Iterate quickly, be responsive
