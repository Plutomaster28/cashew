# Cashew Code of Conduct

## The Short Version

Don't be an asshole.

Cashew is a systems project. Discussions should be technical, respectful, and productive. 
If you cannot engage without hostility, harassment, or bad-faith behavior, this is not the place for you.

## The Longer Version

By participating in this repository (issues, pull requests, discussions, etc.), you agree to:

- Be respectful, even in disagreement.
- Criticize ideas, not people.
- Avoid harassment, threats, discrimination, or personal attacks.
- Avoid deliberately disruptive behavior.
- Accept that maintainers make final decisions on scope and direction.

This project prioritizes signal over noise. Repeatedly pushing out-of-scope ideas after they have been declined may be treated as disruptive behavior.

## Enforcement

Maintainers may remove comments, close issues, reject pull requests, or block users who violate this Code of Conduct.

No warnings are guaranteed.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to:
- GitHub issues
- Pull requests
- Discussions
- Any official Cashew community space

It does not regulate how you use the software outside this repository.

## Final Note

Cashew is infrastructure. Keep it professional.
